## Page-Specific Rules

### Product Direction Override (Authoritative)

- This is an operational admin view, not a marketing dashboard. Use compact 12-14px labels, tabular numerals, restrained borders, and scannable rows.
- Per-model analysis must show requests, input tokens, cache-read tokens, output tokens, total tokens, actual cost, and standard cost as separate values.
- Use a horizontal stacked bar for token composition when a chart is useful: input in graphite, cache read in emerald, output in cobalt. Always pair it with a complete data table.
- Keep requested/upstream/mapped source controls and token/cost view controls. Preserve user drill-down and spending ranking.
- On narrow viewports, retain model identity and token composition first; provide deliberate horizontal table scrolling for secondary cost columns.
- Do not hide values behind hover-only interactions. Tooltips supplement visible labels.

### Layout Overrides

- **Max Width:** 1400px or full-width
- **Grid:** 12-column grid for data flexibility
- **Sections:** 1. Dynamic hero (personalized), 2. Relevant features, 3. Tailored testimonials, 4. Smart CTA

### Spacing Overrides

- **Content Density:** High — optimize for information display

### Typography Overrides

- No overrides — use Master typography

### Color Overrides

- **Strategy:** Adaptive based on user data. A/B test color variations per segment.

### Component Overrides

- No overrides — use Master component specs
